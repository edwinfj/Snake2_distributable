# Snake v2 distributable
### A hobbyist project inspired by the classical game "Snake"

It was done during my undergraduate years. I recently happened to find it in my old computer before I partitioned the disk and installed linux. Thought it might be a better idea to share it with the world than let rot in my computer.

This project was documented and commented in Chinese. Some files already have English versions, some are yet to be translated.

To know what "Snake v2" is and how to play, please refer to *"Game_Manual.html"*.

The graphic rendering of this project is enabled by GDI+ (*yes I know it's outdated and inefficient)*, so the program is run on windows platform only.

This project is distributed under BSD License (the 4 clauses one).

Future improvement and modification can be expected.
