# Snake v2 distributable
##### An undergraduate course project inspired by the classical game "Snake".
<br><br>
What the hack is this repo?
<br><br>

Well, I'm planning to buy a new computer. My current computer is quite old aged. You can imagine those days without clouuuuuuuuds. Many of my documents were just stored local. So I was cleaning those files and transferring useful ones to the clouds.
<br><br>

Suddenly I found this old project, which dated ~7 years back, when I was still an undergraduate student. It reminds me of those days, those days that I really cherish.
<br><br>

So I plan to upload it to github, to share with the world, as a celebration.
<br><br>

This project was documented and commented in Chinese. Some files already have English versions, some are yet to be translated.
<br><br>

To know what the blooding hell "Snake v2" is, please refer to *"Game_Manual.html"*.
